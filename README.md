# MazesForProgrammers

An Elixir/Phoenix/Elm framework for playing around with [Mazes for Programmers](http://www.mazesforprogrammers.com/), by [Jamis Buck](https://twitter.com/jamis).

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
